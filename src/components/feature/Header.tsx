I’ve successfully created the Askademics platform for engineering students! Here’s what I’ve built:

Homepage Features:

Professional hero section with collaborative learning messaging
Four main service cards highlighting your core offerings
Benefits section showcasing community, accessibility, and collaboration
Strong call-to-action encouraging student sign-ups
Services Page:

Detailed breakdown of each service with real-world examples
Interactive elements like lecture schedules and study partner listings
Professional engineering-focused imagery throughout
Design Elements:

Clean blue and slate engineering color scheme
Responsive design for all devices
Modern typography with professional spacing
Dark/light mode toggle for user preference
Added Features:

Readdy Agent for student support and scheduling assistance
Smooth navigation between pages
Professional footer with social links
The platform is now ready with a modern, clean design that appeals to engineering students. Would you like me to add the Membership page next, or would you prefer to customize any existing sections?

Calendar Setup
The Readdy Agent can help students schedule study sessions and lectures, so setting up your calendar would be beneficial for appointment management.

Restore to Version 1

Remove the log in button, change the 3 content under the "Why choose Askademics?" the first should be "Engage and collaborate with peers within the College of Engineering." the second should be "Access quality education from anywhere, anytime." the third is ok and remove the texts below the three

I’ll remove the login button from the header and update the benefits section content as requested.


2 File Operations
I’ll remove the login button from the header and update the benefits section as requested.

I’ll remove the login button from the header and update the benefits section content as requested.


1 File Operations
I’ll remove the login button from the header and update the benefits section content as requested.


1 File Operations
I’ve successfully updated your website:

Removed the login button from both desktop and mobile navigation
Updated the benefits section with your requested content:
First benefit: “Engage and collaborate with peers within the College of Engineering.”
Second benefit: “Access quality education from anywhere, anytime.”
Third benefit: Kept the existing collaboration content
Removed the extra text below each benefit as requested
The header now only shows the dark mode toggle and “Join Now” button, creating a cleaner navigation experience focused on getting users to join your platform.

Restore to Version 2

remove this whole

I’ll remove the entire CTA section for you.


1 File Operations
I’ll remove the entire CTA section from your home page.


2 File Operations
I’ve successfully removed the entire CTA section from your home page. The section with “Ready to Transform Your Engineering Education?” and all its content has been completely deleted, and the page now flows directly from the benefits section to the footer.

Restore to Version 3

remove all the learn more button, remove the dark mode/light mode button, remove the explore services button and insert this link "https://discord.gg/kDYFKkRszp" onto the join now button

I’ll help you make those changes to your website. Let me update the header, services section, and hero section to remove the buttons you mentioned and add the Discord link to the “Join Now” button.


3 File Operations
I’ve successfully made all the requested changes to your website:

Removed all “Learn More” buttons from the services section
Removed the dark mode/light mode toggle from the header
Removed the “Explore Services” button from the hero section
Added the Discord link (https://discord.gg/kDYFKkRszp) to both “Join Now” buttons in the header and hero section
The navigation is now cleaner with just the “Join Now” button that links directly to your Discord server. Users can easily join your engineering community with a single click from either the header or the main hero section.

Version 4

give the downloadable code

I understand you want to download the code for your Askademics project. However, I don’t have a tool to provide downloadable code files directly.

Here are a few options for you:

Copy the code manually
I can show you the current code files if you need to copy specific files
Use your development environment
If you’re working in a code editor, you should be able to save/export the project files
Contact Readdy support
They may have export functionality available
Would you like me to show you the current code for any specific files so you can copy them? Or would you prefer guidance on how to access the download feature through Readdy’s platform?

give me the code

I’ll provide you with all the current code files from your Askademics project. Let me retrieve them for you:
